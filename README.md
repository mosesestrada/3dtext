Your first step is to insert a word art text box. It's on the far right of the screen.

<br />
Choose any style you'd like. I chose the top left.

<br />
Change the depth. Change the colors anyway you'd like.

<br />
That's it, very simple. You can change the colors under quick styles and you can always change the text to something else.

  Using the text wrapping tutorial I made previously I was able to make this. Microsoft Word makes formatting a document with images very easy. Don't forget to text wrap. If you're going to add a background set your background to "behind text" when applying text wrapping to it.

I hope you enjoyed this demonstration.
